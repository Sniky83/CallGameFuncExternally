# CallGameFuncExternally
A PoC coded in C++ to inject ASM into a process to exec game functions or inject any shellcode.<br/>
I done this on Assault Cube game where I called the "Print Console" game function externally and writing anything into it.<br/>
It means that you can create a cheat for example and write "Unlimited ammo enabled" in the console when you hit a specific Key to activate/desactivate your cheat.
## Here is the PoC video
